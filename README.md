Form submission sends data to a free backend server (Formspree).
After submission, the data will email the details of the user into the server and will update to my email.

To run the website on your local machince, I suggest using a platform or a coding software like Visual Studio Code(the one I'm using for easier implementations).

Download the Zipped File that includes all of the codes(HTML, CSS, JS), and the assets(img) for the visualizations. 

It's been too long since the last time I've done tasks like this so I had to do some revisions again. Hopefully the functionality and the UI/UX of the websites will at least give me good marks.

Appreciate the time and chance on the task.
