Form submission sends data to a free backend server (Formspree).
After submission, the data will email the details of the user into the server and will update to my email.

To run the website on your local machince, I suggest using a platform or a coding software like Visual Studio Code(the one I'm using for easier implementations).

1. Download the Zipped File that includes all of the codes(HTML, CSS, JS), and the assets(img) for the visualizations. The vendor folder contains bootstraps or external google fonts for the CSS/JS implementations. 
2. Unzipped the folder and keep it locally on your machine(Desktop as it is easier to find and run on a localhost).
3. Run the codes after opening the unzipped folder and deploy the live server online (ex. port5500) on a localhost server to run the landing page.
It's been too long since the last time I've done tasks like this so I had to do some revisions again. Hopefully the functionality and the UI/UX of the website will at least give me good marks and to your satisfactions.

Appreciate the time and chance given to me on the task.
